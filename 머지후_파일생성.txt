Dear Mountcarmel,

I hope this email finds you well. My name is Lim Lim-dong , and I am reaching out regarding an issue with email communication.

My wife and I have been attempting to communicate with the dentalreceptionist@mountcarmel.ca and manager(ahaddad@mountcarmel.ca) via email. 

However, we have been informed that they did not receive our emails. 
In an effort to rectify this situation, I am resending our message to the email address provided on your website.

If you have received this email, I kindly request that you forward it to the receptionist and manager on our behalf.
 We have attempted to reach out to them multiple times, but unfortunately, our messages seem to have gone undelivered.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause, but we are becoming increasingly frustrated by the lack of response.
Your assistance in ensuring our message reaches the appropriate recipients would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you for your attention to this matter.

Best regards, Lim Lim-dong
